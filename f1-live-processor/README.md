# f1-live-processor

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

If you want to learn more about Quarkus, please visit its website: <https://quarkus.io/>.

## Testing the application with local K8s
This application depends on interacting with other components, both upstream and downstream to do its job:

    A(F1 mock server) --> B(F1 live timing connector)
    B --> C(Kafka)
    C --> D("`**F1 live processor**`")
    D --> E[(Postgresql)]
```
When developing and testing with a local K8s runtime, you can activate all the prerequisites by running the following commands:

Navigate to the folder `./kubernetes-manifests/prerequisites-1` and run the following command:
```console
$ kubectl apply --server-side -k .
```
> The installation may report errors on the first run. In that case just re-run the install command.

In order to uninstall the services, run:
```console
$ kubectl delete -k .
```
Do the same for the folder `./kubernetes-manifests/prerequisites-1`.

Lastly, start the `f1-live-processor` application via skaffold. Navigate to the project root and run
```console
$ skaffold dev
```

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:

```shell script
./mvnw quarkus:dev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at <http://localhost:8080/q/dev/>.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:

```shell script
./mvnw package
```

It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.jar.type=uber-jar
```

The application, packaged as an _über-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar target/*-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Dnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Dnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/f1-live-processor-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult <https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling>.
